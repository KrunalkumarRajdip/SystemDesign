# System Design Repository

Welcome to my system design repository! This repository is a collection of documents and resources related to system design, covering a wide range of topics including scalability, reliability, performance optimization, and more. Whether you're preparing for interviews, learning about distributed systems, or looking for reference materials, you'll find valuable content here.

## About System Design

System design is the process of designing the architecture of complex software systems to meet specific requirements such as scalability, reliability, and performance. It involves understanding various components of the system, their interactions, and how they work together to achieve the desired functionality.

## Contents

### 1. [Scalability](/scalability.md)

This document covers strategies for designing scalable systems that can handle increasing loads and growing user bases. Topics include horizontal and vertical scaling, sharding, load balancing, and more.

### 2. [Reliability and Availability](/reliability_availability.md)

Learn about techniques for building reliable and highly available systems that can withstand failures and ensure uninterrupted service. Topics include redundancy, fault tolerance, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery.

### 3. [Performance Optimization](/performance_optimization.md)

Discover methods for optimizing the performance of software systems to deliver fast response times and efficient resource utilization. Topics include caching, indexing, algorithm optimization, and profiling.

### 4. [Data Management](/data_management.md)

Explore strategies for managing and storing data efficiently in distributed systems. Topics include database technologies, data replication, partitioning, consistency models, and data archival.

### 5. [System Architecture](/system_architecture.md)

Learn about designing modular and extensible architectures that facilitate easy maintenance, scalability, and future enhancements. Topics include microservices, service-oriented architecture (SOA), and event-driven architecture.

### 6. [Security](/security.md)

Understand best practices for securing software systems and protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access and attacks. Topics include encryption, authentication, authorization, and threat modeling.
